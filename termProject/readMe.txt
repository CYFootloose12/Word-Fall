For my term project, I created a typing game that is called Word Fall.
The objective of the game is to type in the letters of various words that
have fallen. You are allotted 20 missed letters. You can get them back through
scoring points on words longer than five letters long. Once you have typed
in a potential word, the program checks if that entered word is a valid
by seeing if the letters exist and if the word is in the dictionary.

This game only uses python, the 2.7.2 version and Tkinter. Python and Tkinter
should already be installed on your computer.

The game should run in the termProject.py file. This file is where the entire
game is. The allWords.txt file is used as a dictionary in the game and the
fallingLetters.gif is a picture of letters falling.
